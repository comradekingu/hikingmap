# Norwegian hiking map

Originally from [svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/rendering/nor-hikingmap](https://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/rendering/nor-hikingmap/)

Mapnik style sheets that implements conventions often seen in Norwegian hiking and nordic skiing maps. The separate style sheets for winter and summer features different colour schemes.

The summer map is a hiking map and includes support for these tags:

```
trailblazed=yes (and marked_trail=blue for compatibility)
trail_visibility=* -- indistinct trails are shown with open dashing
tracktype=grade1-2 -- often used on "trillestier"
tracktype=grade3-5 -- tracks from tractors or logging machines
```

The winter map tones down paths and instead shows skiing tracks:

```
piste:type=nordic|downhill
piste:difficulty=*
piste:grooming=*
```

Additionally, hiking related POIs are shown from lower zoom levels.
Examples are trailhead parking lots "utfartsparkering"; amenity=parking with hiking=yes, sports chapels; amenity=place_of_worship with hiking=yes, serviced and unlocked cabins and emergency shelters, lean-tos and viewpoints.

The style sheets are modular, making reuse and customization easier.

## Cartography and symbols

The cartography in these maps are influenced by hiking maps published by Asker Skiklubb (http://asker-skiklubb.no/), which are essentially orienteering maps that have been cleaned up visually, and added POIs, place names and highlighting of skiing tracks and marked hiking trails.

Symbols are taken from a standard created by the Norwegian mapping authorities, that are now freely available, and used with permission.

  Symbolfonter for friluftsliv og sport

  Landkartdivisjonen. ISBN 82-90408-52-8, Retrieved from
  http://www.statkart.no/filestore/Standardisering/docs/symbol.pdf

This standard defines CMYK colour values for symbol classes.
The RGB equivalents used:

```
#d0006f (purple) -- activities
#007d33 (green)  -- nature areas
#b21416 (red)    -- culture and entertainment
#007db4 (blue)   -- services and transport
```

## Contours or hillshading

Terrain and elevation are normally shown using contour lines and/or hillshading in hiking maps. Norway are affected by the fact that the SRTM DEM stops at 60.4Â° north, which includes "Nordmarka".

viewfinderpanoramas.com and ASTER offer more coverage, but legal restrictions on reuse of these data sets are unclear.

## Installation and usage

The style sheets require Mapnik 0.7.1.

Assume the inc folder from the standard OSM Mapnik style sheet.
It is suggested to create a symlink to a checkout of this.

Import OSM data using an osm2pgsql style file where
`importadditions.osm2pgsql.style` are appended to checkout of
[svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/export/osm2pgsql/default.style](http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/export/osm2pgsql/default.style)

Point your generate_tiles.py script or mod_tile config
to hikingmap.xml and/or pistemap.xml
